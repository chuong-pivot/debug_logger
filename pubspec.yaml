# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
   # This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
   # The 'pluginClass' specifies the class (in Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, etc.)
   # which should be registered in the plugin registry. This is required for
   # using method channels.
   # The Android 'package' specifies package in which the registered class is.
   # This is required for using method channels on Android.
   # The 'ffiPlugin' specifies that native code should be built and bundled.
   # This is required for using `dart:ffi`.
   # All these are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
   # adding or updating assets for this project.

      platforms:
         android:
            package: com.chuong.debug_logger.debug_logger
            pluginClass: DebugLoggerPlugin

   # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
   # assets:
   #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
   #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
   #
   # For details regarding assets in packages, see
   # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
   #
   # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
   # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

   # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
   # example:
   # fonts:
   #   - family: Schyler
   #     fonts:
   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
   #         style: italic
   #   - family: Trajan Pro
   #     fonts:
   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
   #         weight: 700
   #
   # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
   # https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
